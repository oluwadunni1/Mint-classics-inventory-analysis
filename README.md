# Mint-classics-MYSQL Project

## Overview
Mint Classics, a retailer specializing in classic model cars and other collectible vehicles, is considering closing one of its storage facilities. To support this data-driven decision, the company seeks insights on inventory optimization and warehouse consolidation.

Using MySQL Workbench, I conducted an in-depth analysis of the company's inventory and sales data to identify inefficiencies, assess inventory turnover, and determine the most suitable warehouse for closure.

## Objectives
1. Explore products currently in inventory.

2. Determine important factors that may influence inventory reorganization/reduction.

3. Provide analytic insights and data-driven recommendations
