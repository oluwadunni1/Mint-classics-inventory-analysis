# Mint Classics Inventory Optimization Project  

## Overview  
Mint Classics, a retailer specializing in classic model cars and collectible vehicles, is evaluating the potential closure of one of its storage facilities. To support this data-driven decision, the project focused on analyzing inventory efficiency, warehouse capacity, sales performance, and product movement patterns.

The analysis combined SQL for data extraction, Python for further analysis and statistical testing, and Tableau for developing an executive dashboard to present key findings to stakeholders.

## Objectives  
- Explore products currently in inventory.  
- Identify key factors influencing inventory reorganization and reduction.  
- Provide analytical insights and data-driven recommendations.  

## Data & Methodology  
- Data was stored in a MySQL relational database created and populated from a provided SQL script.

- MySQL Workbench was used to write and run queries to extract insights on:
  - Warehouse capacity utilization
  - Revenue performance
  - Product line distribution
  - Delivery performance
  - Stock level performance

- Extracted data was imported into Python for:
  - Additional analysis and transformation
  - Statistical testing to support findings
  - Creation of combined datasets for visualization
  
- Results were visualized in Tableau, producing an executive summary report.
